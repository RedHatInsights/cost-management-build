To access these options later, use\n * {@link Client.getOptions}. Also, the Backend instance is available via\n * {@link Client.getBackend}.\n *\n * If a Dsn is specified in the options, it will be parsed and stored. Use\n * {@link Client.getDsn} to retrieve the Dsn at any moment. In case the Dsn is\n * invalid, the constructor will throw a {@link SentryException}. Note that\n * without a valid Dsn, the SDK will not send any events to Sentry.\n *\n * Before sending an event via the backend, it is passed through\n * {@link BaseClient.prepareEvent} to add SDK information and scope data\n * (breadcrumbs and context). To add more custom information, override this\n * method and extend the resulting prepared event.\n *\n * To issue automatically created events (e.g. via instrumentation), use\n * {@link Client.captureEvent}. It will prepare the event and pass it through\n * the callback lifecycle. To issue auto-breadcrumbs, use\n * {@link Client.addBreadcrumb}.\n *\n * @example\n * class NodeClient extends BaseClient<NodeBackend, NodeOptions> {\n *   public constructor(options: NodeOptions) {\n *     super(NodeBackend, options);\n *   }\n *\n *   // ...\n * }\n */\nvar BaseClient = /** @class */ (function () {\n    /**\n     * Initializes this client instance.\n     *\n     * @param backendClass A constructor function to create the backend.\n     * @param options Options for the client.\n     */\n    function BaseClient(backendClass, options) {\n        /** Array of used integrations. */\n        this._integrations = {};\n        /** Is the client still processing a call?
